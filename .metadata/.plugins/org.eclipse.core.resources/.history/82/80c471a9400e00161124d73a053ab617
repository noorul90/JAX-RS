we have to add expires()/expires header as part of http 1.0 protocol

but as part of http 1.1 expires()/expires header will be remove/deprecated and in place of
expires header we use cacheControl()/cache control header



       request      (recieve the request and redirected to resource)
       
CLIENT------------>CDN(content delivery network) SERVER----------------------------------->Restfull RESOURCE
               
                (it will take the response from RESORCE and store into local cache       (it will compute the response and send back to the client/CDN server
                  till the expires/cacheControl header expires time and then send the        with expires heder or cacheControl header)
                  response back to the client) 
                ( for the next same request within the expires time CDN server check if
                  the response available in the cache then it will never passes the request
                  to resource rather it will send the response back from cache )
                                                                                         

as part of cacheControl header we can pass multiple value as part of response the following are

1.NoStore---->
2.NoCache----->
3.Private----->
4.maxAge------>
5.mustRevalidate---->
6.NoTransform------->

total 6 value we can pass
