we have to add expires()/expires header as part of http 1.0 protocol

but as part of http 1.1 expires()/expires header will be remove/deprecated and in place of
expires header we use cacheControl()/cache control header



       request      (recieve the request and redirected to resource)
       
CLIENT------------>CDN(content delivery network) SERVER----------------------------------->Restfull RESOURCE
               
                (it will take the response from RESORCE and store into local cache       (it will compute the response and send back to the client/CDN server
                  till the expires/cacheControl header expires time and then send the      with expires heder or cacheControl header)
                  response back to the client) 
                ( for the next same request within the expires time CDN server check if
                  the response available in the cache then it will never passes the request
                  to resource rather it will send the response back from cache )
                                                                                         

as part of cacheControl header we can pass multiple value as part of response the following are
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.NoStore---->don't store the data into hardisk/physical disk rather keep the data into memory only when response return by resource

2.NoCache----->client should never cache the data,it will always keep changing

3.Private----->only client will be permit to cache the data ,intermediatery server/CDN server will not be permitted to cache the data

4.maxAge------>how long client store the data into cache so that we can use the same rather we resending the request to the server

4i.sMaxAge----->how long CDN server/intermediatery server has to cache the data insted of client

5.mustRevalidate---->before using the data that are within the cache always go and check with server is the data has been modify or not.
                     if it is not modify use it , if it is modify then revalidate it(means i will send latest data)
6.NoTransform------->the original data/response has to store in the cache in the same way, don't transform the the data while storing

these are the total 6 value that we can pass as part of cacheControl header
