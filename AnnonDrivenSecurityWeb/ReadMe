silorly we can create any number of user as per our business requirement to enable the security constraints

NOTE: in this application we can create three user raaj,john and bob and their role is admin,trader and customer respectively
      but in our web.xml file we can gave access of resource to raaj and bob only which role is admin and customer respectively but not for john which role is trader
      but as per our business requirement we can gave access to resource to anyone

NOTE:To enable roll based security(@RolesAllowed("rollname")) we have to add the following code in web.xml file
    
    <context-param>
		<param-name>resteasy.role.based.security</param-name>
		<param-value>true</param-value>
	</context-param>
 
NOTE: for this application we can create 3 user which is raaj,john,bob and there role is admin,trader,customer respectively
       we can enable authentication in web.xml file and give access of resource only to raaj(admin) and bob(customer) but not to john(trader)
       so john does not have access permission to that resource
